> Discovery service like etcd but implemented with DynamoDB

## Introduction

At the AWS Summit in Amsterdam I spoke with [@sebsto](https://twitter.com/sebsto) regarding service discovery. I asked 
him if `etcd` is a good fit. Besides it probably is a good fit, he came up with an alternative idea. What if `etcd` 
fails because the nodes can't find each other?

The idea is to use `DynamoDB` to keep track of the services. The downside is the extra code you have to write for 
each service. This repo will try to tackle that.
